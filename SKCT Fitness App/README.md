    - Calls RecognitionActivity for prediction and chooses activity with highest confidence score
    - Inserts predicted activity to a SQLite database in the background
    
2. RecognitionActivity
    - Initializes trained CNN classifier
    - Feeds normalized input into the classifier and sends output back to MainActivity
    
3. DisplayStatsActivity
    - Queries the SQLite database to display pie chart on the screen
    
4. Activity
    - Contains database schema in the form of objects (uses Room Persistence Library)
    
5. ActivityDao
    - Provides interface to modify and query the database (through Data Access Objects)
    
6. AppDatabase
    - Initializes an SQLite database for the application
    
7. Constants
